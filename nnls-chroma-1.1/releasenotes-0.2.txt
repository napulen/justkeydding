New features: 

Chordino:
* The new MIDI note output of the estimated chords allows, for example, instant playback of chord notes in Sonic Visualiser.
* new parameter "boost N": allows better recognition of the "no chord" label N (default setting is 0.1, previous Chordino version had no boost, i.e. 0.0).

NNLS Chroma:
* new output "Consonance Estimate". Experimental attempt to capture the tonal consonance in at a given time. Based on the convolution of a simple consonance profile with the semitone spectrum.

Bug fixes:

* Default chord dictionary loads when no chord.dict file found in Vamp path.
* Corrected parameter range for spectral rollon parameter (Chordino).
* Semitone Spectrum has values at zero energy frames (NNLS Chroma).
* Crash with non-standard input resolved (now amplitude-limited).
* minor internal fixes.
