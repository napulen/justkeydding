NNLS Chroma 0.3 -- Release Notes

General Description:

A Vamp plugin library for harmony and chord extraction with some features aimed at amateur musicians, and some at music information retrieval researchers.
It contains the Chordino, NNLS Chroma and Tuning plugins.
For more information see README or http://isophonics.net/nnls-chroma

Feature changes:

in Chordino: 
* added Log-Likelihood of Chord Estimate (based on the Viterbi path used for chord estimation),
* added option for Chris Harte's chord syntax,
* removed option for non-HMM chord estimation.

in NNLS-Chroma: 
* removed consonance output.

Bug fixes:
* renamed dim7 chord to half-diminished (m7b5 and :hdim7, respectively), and added the correct chord label to the diminished chord (was empty before, and hence treated as major chord).

Other:
* renamed: spectral roll-off parameter to Bass Noise Threshold (in response to Tim Crawfords comment, thanks!)
